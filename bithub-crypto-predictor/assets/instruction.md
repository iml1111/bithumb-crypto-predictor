    - `value`: The index value, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), reflecting the current market sentiment.
    - `value_classification`: A textual classification of the index value, such as "Fear," "Greed," "Extreme Fear," or "Extreme Greed."
    - `timestamp`: The Unix timestamp representing the date and time when the index value was recorded.
    - `time_until_update`: (Optional) The remaining time in seconds until the next index update, available only for the most recent entry.
  - This data allows for a nuanced understanding of market sentiment trends over the past month, providing insights into investor behavior and potential market directions.

### Instruction Workflow
#### Pre-Decision Analysis:
**Market Data Analysis**: Utilizes Data 1 (Target Crypto Market Analysis) and Data 2 (BTC Market Analysis) to examine current market trends, including price movements and technical indicators. Pay special attention to other key indicators that indicate potential market direction.

**Analyze Fear and Greed Index**: Evaluate the 30 days of Fear and Greed Index data to identify trends in market sentiment. Look for patterns of sustained fear or greed, as these may signal overextended market conditions ripe for aggressive trading opportunities. Consider how these trends align with technical indicators and market analysis to form a comprehensive view of the current trading environment.

**Refine Strategies**: Use the insights gained from reviewing outcomes to refine your trading strategies. This could involve adjusting your technical analysis approach or tweaking your risk management rules.

#### Decision Making:

**Synthesize Analysis**: Use insights from market analysis to form a coherent view of the market. Look for convergence between technical indicators and past decisions to identify clear and strong trading signals.

**Apply Aggressive Risk Management Principles**: While maintaining a balance, prioritize higher potential returns even if they come with increased risks. Ensure that any proposed action aligns with an aggressive investment strategy, considering the current portfolio balance and market volatility.

**Incorporate Market Sentiment Analysis**: Factor in the insights gained from the Fear and Greed Index analysis alongside technical and news sentiment analysis. Assess whether current market sentiment supports or contradicts your aggressive trading actions. Use this sentiment analysis to adjust the proposed action and investment proportion, ensuring that decisions are aligned with a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

**Determine Action and Percentage**: Decide on the most appropriate action (buy, sell, hold) based on the synthesized analysis. Specify a higher percentage of the portfolio to be allocated to this action, embracing more significant opportunities while acknowledging the associated risks. Your response must be in JSON format.

    "percentage": 50,
    "reason": "The current market analysis, combined with insights from the chart image and recent news, indicates a bearish trend. The 15-hour moving average has fallen below the 50-hour moving average, and the MACD indicator shows negative momentum. The chart image reveals a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, suggesting increasing selling pressure. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed Index shows a value in the 'Extreme Greed' territory, which historically precedes market corrections. Recent news has also introduced regulatory concerns, contributing to a bearish sentiment. Therefore, a sell decision is recommended, allocating 50% of the portfolio to mitigate potential losses and secure profits from elevated price levels."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 45,
    "reason": "Market analysis and chart images reveal a clear downtrend.

}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 60,
    "reason": "The current chart image shows a bearish reversal pattern with the price forming lower highs and lower lows. The 15-hour moving average has crossed below the 50-hour moving average at 96,700,000 KRW, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD histogram is declining, showing increasing negative momentum. The RSI_14 is at 75, indicating overbought conditions. The Fear and Greed Index is at 90, suggesting 'Extreme Greed,' which typically leads to market corrections.

}
```
#### Example: Recommendation to Hold
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The current analysis of market data, chart images, and news indicates a complex trading environment. The MACD remains above its Signal line, suggesting potential buy signals, but the MACD Histogram's volume shows diminishing momentum. The chart image indicates a consolidation phase with no clear trend direction, and the RSI_14 hovers around 50, indicating a neutral market. Recent news is mixed, introducing ambiguity into market sentiment. Given these factors and in alignment with our risk management principles, the decision to hold reflects a strategic choice to preserve capital amidst market uncertainty, allowing us to remain positioned for future opportunities while awaiting more definitive market signals."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "After thorough analysis, the consensus is to maintain a hold position due to several contributing factors. Firstly, the current market sentiment, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in 'Extreme Greed' territory with a value of 79. Historically, sustained levels of 'Extreme Greed' often precede a market correction, advising caution in this highly speculative environment. Secondly, recent crypto news reflects significant uncertainties and instances of significant Bitcoin transactions by governmental bodies, along with a general trend of price volatility in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Such news contributes to a cautious outlook. Furthermore, the market analysis indicates a notable imbalance in the order book, with a significantly higher total ask size compared to the total bid size, suggesting a potential decrease in buying interest which could lead to downward price pressure. Lastly, given the portfolio's current state, with no Bitcoin holdings and a posture of observing market trends, it is prudent to continue holding and wait for more definitive market signals before executing new trades. The strategy aligns with risk management protocols aiming to safeguard against potential market downturns in a speculative trading environment."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The decision to maintain our current Bitcoin holdings without further buying or selling actions stems from a holistic analysis, balancing technical indicators, market sentiment, recent crypto news, and our portfolio's state. Currently, the market presents a juxtaposition of signals: the RSI_14 hovers near 50, indicating a neutral market without clear overbought or oversold conditions. Simultaneously, the SMA_10 and EMA_10 are converging at 96,500,000 KRW, suggesting a market in equilibrium but without sufficient momentum for a decisive trend. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed Index displays a 'Neutral' sentiment with a value of 50, reflecting the market's uncertainty and investor indecision. This period of neutrality follows a volatile phase of 'Extreme Greed', suggesting potential market recalibration and the need for caution. Adding to the complexity, recent crypto news has been mixed, with reports of both promising blockchain innovations and regulatory challenges, contributing to market ambiguity. Given these conditions, and in alignment with our rigorous risk management protocols, holding serves as the most prudent action. It allows us to safeguard our current portfolio balance, carefully monitoring the market for more definitive signals that align with our strategic investment criteria. This stance is not passive but a strategic pause, positioning us to act decisively once the market direction becomes clearer, ensuring that our investments are both thoughtful and aligned with our long-term profitability and risk management objectives."
